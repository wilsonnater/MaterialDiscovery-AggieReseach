the next step is to be able to do this with any of the composition or structure featurizers
All the featurizers are here : https://hackingmaterials.github.io/matminer/featurizer_summary.html

Choose one of the featurizer sets below and create a code that can use these featurizer on our data. (Also edit this document saying which one you are using)

Set 1: [ElementProperty, OxidationStates, AtomicOrbitals, BandCenter, ElectronegativityDiff, DensityFeatures, RadialDistributionFunction, PartialRadialDistributionFunction, ElectronicRadialDistributionFunction, CoulombMatrix]
Set 2: [ElectronAffinity, Stoichiometry, ValenceOrbital, IonProperty, ElementFraction, SineCoulombMatrix, OrbitalFieldMatrix, MinimumRelativeDistances, SiteStatsFingerpriSOAPnt, EwaldEnergy]
Set 3: [TMetalFraction, CohesiveEnergy, Miedema, YangSolidSolution, AtomicPackingEfficiency, BondFractions, BagofBonds, StructuralHeterogeneity, MaximumPackingEfficiency, CGCNNFeaturizer, SOAP]

In each set, the first couple of featurizers are composition, while the the last ones are structure featurizers
You should use the example data posted on the github
This is where the source code for all the featurizers are: https://github.com/hackingmaterials/matminer/tree/master/matminer/featurizers


I can do composition! - Haley
