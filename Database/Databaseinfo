Database Information:

So the database should hold 5 different pieces of information: the lattice, the atomic information, 
the forces on the atoms, the stress on the strucutre, and where the structure is from.

The structure can be in two forms: a matrix form: [[A_1 A_2 A_3][B_1 B_2 B_3][C_1 C_2 C_3]] 
or it can be written as A,B,C(the lengths of each side) and alpha, beta, gamma(the angles between
each vector) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravais_lattice#In_3_dimensions, shows examples of the 2nd
notation)

The atomic positions will be three values specifing the x,y,z position of the atom and what the atom is. 
The difficulty is that not every strucutre will have the same number of atoms. So this will have to be
able to store a different number of atoms.

The stress on the strucutre is related to the latiice and is in the matrix form of it 
[[A_1 A_2 A_3][B_1 B_2 B_3][C_1 C_2 C_3]], where A_1 and such are stress.

The forces on the atoms is in the same form as the positions, except now the x,y,z are F_x, F_y, F_z
the forces in the x,y, and z directions.

Where the structure is from is just a refrence so we can find the strucutre again if something is strange.
