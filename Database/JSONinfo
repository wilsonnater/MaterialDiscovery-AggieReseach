So JSON is not a database format, but a format for transfering data from a database.
It is still useful to learn how to work with it, because it is how we will get data
and we might still use it as our database, becuase it can be used that way. It won't have
all the things a database might, but it will still store data.

JSON is also usually already a part of python, so just using import JSON should allow you to 
read JSON files in python. There are plenty of resources if you google JSON python to learn it.
